I'm a Postdoc at [Max Planck Institute for Security and Privacy](https://www.mpi-sp.org/), with a Ph.D. from the Seoul National University.
My work aims to harden systems against real-world threats by bridging the gap between offensive research and defensive mechanisms.

I am always open to discussing new ideas and collaborations. Feel free to reach out via email.
